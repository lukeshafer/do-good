He goes to dialysis three times a week and is now no longer able to work, and he's struggling to get by. We're hoping to help Mr. Talley however we can. <strong>One meaningful thing we would like to accomplish is allowing him to spend his time with his kids without worrying about how he's going to provide for them.</strong></p><h2>Taking care of our communityÂ </h2><p>June is a great time to help Mr. Talley, who has dedicated his whole life to helping and mentoring kids on the South Side of Columbus - it's home to both Father's Day and Juneteenth. <strong>Please consider your privilege when thinking about donating or helping us fundraise.</strong></p>","href":"https://chuffed.org/project/rally-for-mr-talley"}
