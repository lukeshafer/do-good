He goes to dialysis three times a week and is now no longer able to work, and he's struggling to get by. We're hoping to help Mr. Talley however we can. <strong>One meaningful thing we would like to accomplish is allowing him to spend his time with his kids without worrying about how he's going to provide for them.</strong></p><h2>Taking care of our community&nbsp;</h2><p>June is a great time to help Mr. Talley, who has dedicated his whole life to helping and mentoring kids on the South Side of Columbus - it's home to both Father's Day and Juneteenth. <strong>Please consider your privilege when thinking about donating or helping us fundraise.</strong></p>","donationLink":"https://chuffed.org/project/rally-for-mr-talley","slug":"rally-for-mr-talley"}}}}]}]},"footer":{"resourcePages":[{"title":"Join","content":"<p>This is the join page</p>","createdAt":"2022-06-27T05:02:01.765Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-27T05:02:03.812Z","publishedAt":"2022-06-27T05:02:03.810Z","slug":"join"}],"dgcPages":[{"title":"About Us","content":"<h1>About Do Good Collective</h1><p>Do Good Collective is a mutual aid fundraising group focused on helping others and raising the needs of disabled people, people of color, people in the LGBTQIA+ community, and more!</p><p>We're a community of over thirty people from various fields and experiences: artists, developers, students, organizers, parents.
